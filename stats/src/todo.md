# TODO

x remove '/' from country names
- clear naming of axes
- n-cases starting point display toggle
- n-day average line
- cases in relation to population
- deaths column in dataframe
- show death graphs in tabs
- population column in dataframe
- index column in table (independent on sorting)
- better/cleaner layout/colors
- keep table header always visible
- new features like:
    - detect second wave
    - detect current criticality (e.g. highest relative increase in last 7 days)
    - detect highest "weekend" gaps
    - detect non-regular datasets (strange value changes etc.)
    - store presets (e.g. Country selection)
